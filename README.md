This project is a Python-based desktop application that provides real-time and historical weather data for any city using the WeatherAPI. Additionally, it leverages machine learning to predict weather conditions based on user-provided inputs for temperature, humidity, and wind speed.  
<br>
Features<br>  
1. Real-Time Weather Data: Fetch current weather details, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and condition.  
2. Historical Weather Data: Retrieve historical weather data for a city within a specified date range.  
3. Machine Learning Prediction: Train a weather prediction model using historical data and predict weather conditions based on user inputs.  
4. Graphical User Interface (GUI): User-friendly interface built with Tkinter.  
<br>
Technologies Used<br>  
1. Programming Language: Python  
2. GUI Framework: Tkinter  
3. Data Handling: pandas  
4. Machine Learning: scikit-learn (Naive Bayes Classifier)    
5. API Integration: requests (WeatherAPI)  
6. Visualization: PIL (Python Imaging Library)  
<br>
Requirements<br>  
To run this application, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:<br>  
1. tkinter  
2. requests  
3. pandas  
4. scikit-learn  
5. python-dotenv  
6. Pillow  
<br>
Model Training Details<br>  
1. Algorithm: Naive Bayes Classifier  
2. Input Features:  
a. Temperature (Â°C)
b. Humidity (%)   
c. Wind Speed (km/h)  
3. Target: Weather Condition (encoded as a categorical variable)  
4. Data Source: Historical weather data fetched from WeatherAPI.
