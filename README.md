This project is a Python-based desktop application that provides real-time and historical weather data for any city using the WeatherAPI. Additionally, it leverages machine learning to predict weather conditions based on user-provided inputs for temperature, humidity, and wind speed.  
<br>
Features<br>  
1. Real-Time Weather Data: Fetch current weather details, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and condition.  
2. Historical Weather Data: Retrieve historical weather data for a city within a specified date range.  
3. Machine Learning Prediction: Train a weather prediction model using historical data and predict weather conditions based on user inputs.  
4. Graphical User Interface (GUI): User-friendly interface built with Tkinter.  
<br>


Technologies Used<br>  

1. Programming Language: Python<br>
2. GUI Framework: Tkinter<br>   
3. Data Handling: pandas<br>     
4. Machine Learning: scikit-learn (Naive Bayes Classifier) <br>    
5. API Integration: requests (WeatherAPI)<br>   
6. Visualization: PIL (Python Imaging Library)  <br>

<br>

6. Pillow  <br> 
<br>


Model Training Details<br>  

1. Algorithm: Naive Bayes Classifier  <br> 
2. Input Features: <br>  
a. Temperature (Â°C)<br> 
b. Humidity (%)   <br> 
c. Wind Speed (km/h)<br>   
3. Target: Weather Condition (encoded as a categorical variable) <br>  
4. Data Source: Historical weather data fetched from WeatherAPI.<br>
